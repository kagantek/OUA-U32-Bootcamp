# Game Description

Grimwood is a 3D, single-player, fantasy, adventure, role-playing game with third-person player controls. With our main character named Erika, the player will be able to interact with NPCs in five different regions on the map we designed, have dialogues with them and fulfill the tasks given to them. The player who spends time in these different regions will also be more immersed in the story of the Grimwood World with each new task she does. The five different regions represent the levels of our open-world game and each region has more challenging tasks.

# Game Story

*"The Grimwood Realm was a place of legends and peaceful creatures. Erika and her family lived peacefully in their own little cabin. One day, a curse plunged the forest into darkness and unleashed evil spirits. Erika's family was attacked by these creatures. Erika swore revenge on the cursed monsters that killed her family when she was a child. She set out to find the origin of the curse and save the realm. Along the way, she explored difficult areas one by one. She traveled the entire realm, from Elementaria, where the dragon's magic caused magical crystals to exist, to the Ancient Dwarven Ruins. She fought dark creatures in cursed graveyards and tried to unravel the mysteries of the forest. She encountered the inhabitants of the forest and the village at every step. Her legend continued to be told by the bards of the realms..."*

  ### Sprint Review
  
  + <b>Sprint Review Participants:</b> `Kerem Aslan URAL`, `İsrafil ERCAN`, `İrem Eylül ÖZTEK`, `Kağan TEK`.
  + A comprehensive game map was designed using the `Terrain tool`.
  + `The village area`, which represents the first level of our game, has been designed.
  + The archer Erika model from the `Mixamo platform` was used as the main character.
  + `3D assets`, especially suitable for the fantasy and adventure genre, were researched and used in level design.
  + Basic `movement codes` of the character have been written and added to the character.
  + Our basic `movement animations`, along with our movement codes, have been edited and added to the character.
 
  ### Sprint Retrospective

  + Although the use of the GitHub desktop application by the team caused difficulties at the beginning of the sprint, this problem was solved thanks to the training we provided within ourselves.
  + Even though we, as a team, were undecided for a while about our main character's motivation to go on an adventure, we decided that this motivation would be revenge.
  + Since the size of some of the models used reduces the performance of the game, it was decided to use smaller and optimized models.
  + Although there was a disagreement about whether our character would be a melee or a ranged fighter, it was ultimately decided that she would be a ranged fighter archer.
  + It has been decided to increase the number of tasks and scores of team members in the next sprint.
  + As a result, although we encountered minor problems and disagreements, the sprint tasks we set were completed and the sprint process was close to what we expected.

   + Enhanced `teleportation mechanics` with `radial dynamic UI` added to the game.
   + `Game Over screen` and `In game pause menu` are designed and added to the game.
   + `Dynamic Skybox` and `Day & Night Cycle` mechanics added to the game.
   + `Character health mechanics` and `related UI designs` are added to the game.
   + `A mini parkour mechanics` that is activated by `a secret button` has been added to the game.
   + A beautiful `cinematic` beginning has been added, telling the game story with `AI-powered visuals`.
   + `A fantasy map` that is exactly compatible with our game map has been designed and added to the game.
   + An improved `mini map` that shows our character, NPCs and enemy AI with `special icons` and a `large map` that shows our `character's coordinates` have been added to the game.
   + `Game music & sound effects` and their `scripts` are added to the game. (Musics are different in battle zone and other parts of the map.)

   + `Mob fight` and `interaction mechanics` added to the game.

  ### Sprint Retrospective

   + `Team spirit was maintained`, possible discussions were prevented, and team members congratulated each other for working devotedly throughout the Scrum process.
   + The project development process, which was interrupted due to internships and exams, was resolved by adopting a sequential development order.
   + Although the game was output in WebGL format without any problems, the platforms did not allow it due to size. Due to the large size of our game, a build that can be downloaded and played was preferred rather than a structure that can be played online.    
   + It was decided to cancel bend mechanics of character to focus on other features.
   + It was decided to cancel melee attack mechanics for our character to improve aim mechanics.
   + It was decided to cancel object moving mechanics of objects to focus on more scene details.
   + It was decided to cancel a final boss level and boss fight mechanics to improve other five territories.
   + As a result, although we canceled some tasks, it was a much more intense and challenging process than the first two sprints. However, since everyone in the team got used to each other's working order, the project was developed much more efficiently.
   + `The demo day presentation` was discussed and a preparation plan was created.
   + Preliminary discussions were held about `the future planning` of the project and it was decided to develop our game.
   + As a team, we had `a small celebration` with the justified pride of having produced a beautiful project at the end of the last sprint.
