# Game Description

Grimwood is a 3D, single-player, fantasy adventure game with third-person player controls. The player, with our character named Erika, will fulfill the tasks given to him by NPCs in 5 different regions on the map we designed. These regions also represent the levels of our game. As you complete the missions, these regions will become active on the map. Finally, when all the missions are completed, a new boss area will be active. Our player will fight the main boss and complete the scenario.

# Game Story

*"Grimwood Forest was a place where legends and dark forces ruled. A curse plunged the forest into darkness, unleashing evil spirits. The hope of the village was the young adventurer Erika. When Erika was a child, she swore revenge on the cursed monsters that murdered her family. She sets out to find the origin of the curse and save the forest. Along the way, he explored ancient cemeteries, fought dark creatures, and tried to unravel the mysteries of the forest. At every step, she encountered the inhabitants of the forest and the village and tried to solve their problems. Finally, Erika found the source of the curse: It was a curse inflicted on the forest by an evil monster. By completing challenging missions, he activated the portal deep in the forest, found the location of the monster, defeated it and broke the curse of the forest, bringing peace back to the land."*

  ### Sprint Review
  
  + <b>Sprint Review Participants:</b> `Kerem Aslan URAL`, `İsrafil ERCAN`, `İrem Eylül ÖZTEK`, `Kağan TEK`.
  + A comprehensive game map was designed using the `Terrain tool`.
  + `The village area`, which represents the first level of our game, has been designed.
  + The archer Erika model from the `Mixamo platform` was used as the main character.
  + `3D assets`, especially suitable for the fantasy and adventure genre, were researched and used in level design.
  + Basic `movement codes` of the character have been written and added to the character.
  + Our basic `movement animations`, along with our movement codes, have been edited and added to the character.
 
  ### Sprint Retrospective

  + Although the use of the GitHub desktop application by the team caused difficulties at the beginning of the sprint, this problem was solved thanks to the training we provided within ourselves.
  + Even though we, as a team, were undecided for a while about our main character's motivation to go on an adventure, we decided that this motivation would be revenge.
  + Since the size of some of the models used reduces the performance of the game, it was decided to use smaller and optimized models.
  + Although there was a disagreement about whether our character would be a melee or a ranged fighter, it was ultimately decided that she would be a ranged fighter archer.
  + It has been decided to increase the number of tasks and scores of team members in the next sprint.
  + As a result, although we encountered minor problems and disagreements, the sprint tasks we set were completed and the sprint process was close to what we expected.
