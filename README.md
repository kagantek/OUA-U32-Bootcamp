# Game Story

*Grimwood Forest was a place where legends and dark forces ruled. A curse plunged the forest into darkness, unleashing evil spirits. The hope of the village was the young adventurer Erika. When Erika was a child, she swore revenge on the cursed monsters that murdered her family. She sets out to find the origin of the curse and save the forest. Along the way, he explored ancient cemeteries, fought dark creatures, and tried to unravel the mysteries of the forest. At every step, she encountered the inhabitants of the forest and the village and tried to solve their problems. Finally, Erika found the source of the curse: It was a curse inflicted on the forest by an evil monster.
